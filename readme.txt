Assignment Requirements: 
  Pick out what you want to classify, this must be unique, not an existing set of data or .csv  which you can get off the internet from sites like sci-kit learn, and Kaggle.  You can get the data from the internet, but it has to be uncollated data.
  You may not make up this data.
  You must have the URLs where you got this data from or another source where you got it.

  Write a short word document explaining what you plan to do with this data, where you got it from (URLs also if applicable), and what labels and features, and how many rows it has.
  Then plug in your data and replace the data in the machine learning classification application you built last week. 
  This program should be able to do classification using the ML Scikit Learn library.
  Use a decision Tree as a classifier. 
  Train your classifier based on the data from a toy classifier dataset from the link above that you pick out based on your interests.
  A paragraph explanation of what this program is should be displayed for the user at the top of the program. These are print statements, not comments.
